# Mobincep
Multi-domain learning CNN model for microscopy image classification (full source code will be revealed after manuscript is accepted)
* We present a multi-domain learning architecture that can be successfully used in the classification of very
different types and contents of microscopy images, from subcellular organelles to cells and tissues. 
* Unlike previous methods that employ computationally intensive deep networks or ensemble architectures, we have developed a compact model, called Mobincep, by combining the simple but effective techniques of depthwise separable convolution and the inception module. 
* Additionally, we introduce a novel strategy to directly regulate the latent feature space during training to improve the networkâ€™s performance.
* We evaluated the effectiveness of Mobincep on three different public datasets of microscopy images and compared its performance in single-domain and multiple-domain learning modes. The proposed classifier surpasses state-of-theart results and is robust with respect to limited labeled data. 
* Our approach can be applied to various types of microscopy images, saving the time otherwise needed to design a new network when switching from one biomedical experiment to another.
